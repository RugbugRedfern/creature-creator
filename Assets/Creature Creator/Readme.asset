	Build mode lets you mold your creature's body and attach different body parts to it.
	Paint mode lets you change the primary and secondary colours of your creature's body and attached body parts, as well as the pattern of your creatureâ€™s skin!
	Finally, play mode lets you bring your creation to life!"
