<p align="center">Create your own creatures to explore online worlds with friends and collect new parts to upgrade your stats and abilities! Complete quests, battle enemies, challenge friends to minigames, or just have fun roleplaying — the possibilities are endless when your imagination is the limit!</p>

<p align="center">The creation tool consists of three different modes: build-, paint- and play-mode. Customize the shape of your creature by manipulating its spine and attaching transformable body parts in build mode. Altering your creature then changes its statistics (e.g., weight, speed, health etc.) and attaching certain body parts gives it special abilities (e.g., flying, swimming, biting etc.). You can then change the color of your creature's body and attached body parts, as well as the pattern and texture of your creature's skin in paint mode. Wen you're finished designing your creature, you can bring it to life in play mode! Traverse lush forests, swim in the ocean or fly high above the clouds — your creature will procedurally animate to adapt to its environment.</p>
